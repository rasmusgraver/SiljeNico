      </p>
      <p>Nearly everybody owns a smartphone (60%) and it will become more and more natural to handle almost any activity via the phone.

        <div class='msg_body'>
          <p>SnappOrder er en app for smartphones utviklet av Snappit AS for å modernisere måten vi yter service. Appen forenkler
            interaksjonen mellom gjest og serveringssted, slik at gjesten kan ha fokus på det de er der for;
            <span style='font-weight:bold;'>å nyte opplevelsen du tilbyr dem.</span>
          </p>
          <p>Snart har alle smartphones (90%) og det er etter hvert blitt naturlig å håndtere nesten alle aktiviteter via telefonen.
            Å kunne se menyen og bestille er et helt naturlig skritt i denne utviklingen. For servicebransjen betyr det en mengde nye muligheter
            for kommunikasjon og interaksjon.</p>
          <p>Vårt mål med SnappOrder er at våre kunder skal<span style='font-weight:bold;'> redusere</span> sine kostnader og
            <span style='font-weight:bold;'>generere økt omsetning.</span></p>

          <ol>
            <li>SnappOrder reduserer ventetiden for gjesten, slik at totalopplevelsen blir enda bedre.
              En fornøyd kunde kommer igjen og er verdens beste reklame.</li>
          </ol>
          <h3>ØKT MERSLAG</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Muligheten for mersalg øker fordi gjesten har menyen for hånden til enhver tid og ikke behøver å vente på servitørens
              oppmerksomhet for å overlevere sine ønsker.</li>
            <li>Hver bordsetting okkuperer mindre tid, i og med at ventetid elimineres. Flere bordsettinger = flere betalende gjester.</li>
            <li>Servitøren sparer tid og reduserer antallet tomhendte turer gjennom lokalet, hvilket frigjør tid til å ha en enda bedre
              interaksjon med sine gjester og dermed yte enda bedre service.</li>
          </ol>
          <h3>LETTVINT</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>SnappOrder er enkelt og morsomt å bruke for både gjest og serveringssted.</li>
            <li>SnappOrder er integrert i kassen og betjenes med største enkelhet av servitøren</li>
            <li>Gjennom vår unike integrasjon med kassen er menyen i appen til enhver tid oppdatert via web, uten manuelt arbeid.</li>
            <li>SnappOrder fungerer etter no cure - no pay prinsippet og det er liten risiko involvert i å anskaffe det.</li>

        <h2 class='msg_head gradient'>Hvordan fungerer det i restauranten?</h2>
        <div class='msg_body'>
          <p>SnappOrder er integrert i kassen. Stedets meny lastes opp i appen, direkte fra kassen, automatisk.
            Deretter kan den eventuelt endres i vår Menyeditor, f.eks. med bilder og beskrivelser, ref simulator.</p>
          <p>Gjesten, med appen installert, sjekker inn på et bord og får dermed opp hele menyen og foretar sine valg.
            Disse valgene sendes rett til kassen som gjør servitøren oppmerksom på at det har kommet inn en SnappOrderbestilling.</p>
          <p>Servitøren kontrollerer bestillingen og bekrefter den på sin skjerm.  Om bestillingen inneholder mat vil dette bli sendt rett
            til kjøkkenet på vanlig måte i det servitøren bekrefter. Servitøren tar deretter med seg gjestens ønsker ut til bordet.
            Når gjesten er fornøyd trykker han/hun på 'be om regning'. Den samme visuelle indikatoren dukker opp på servitørens skjerm for
            bekreftelse og utskrift.</p>
