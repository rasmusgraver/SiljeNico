<h2> Accommodation </h2>

<p>
    Now that the responses from the invitations coming in so we will come to put up a proposal to who can share apartments and "seahouses". The overview of this we publish on this page.
</p> <p>
    We recommend Kjerring√∏y Brygge property and will reserve all of our guests in there unless otherwise requested. It is a brand new cabin and hotel complex at sea, which was completed in 2007. All units, be it leilighetsrom or seahouses that live in groups, from 4 to 6 people.
</p> <p>
    As we receive confirmation that we're going to make a suggestion to anyone who can stay together. Naturally, it is up to the individual to determine whether it is okay. 
    The "pier houses" are privately owned and this is why we need to get this country with accommodation as quickly as possible. The booking is an agreement between the hotel and the owner and the sooner we do that the sooner we are sure to accommodate everyone on this site.

<h3>Hotel room / apartment 4 pers</h3>

<p>
    Room is an understatement, since the "room" is designed as an apartment. There is a double bed and two single beds that can be converted into double bed. The room is not self, but a separate room with a sofa and North Norway's most beautiful views.
</p> 

<h3>"Pier house" 6 pers</h3>

<p>
    The "pier houses" are all decorated differently, for the simple reason that they have different owners. The great thing is they all together and with a fantastic view out to the Lofoten Islands. 
    The "pier houses" contains three bedrooms and one or two bathrooms.
