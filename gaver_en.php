<h2>Wedding list</h2>

<p>We have created a wedding list at Illums bolighus in House of Oslo in Vika. </p>
<p>You can download the list here:
    <a href="gaver_list.pdf">Wedding list</a>
</p>

<p>If you want to buy something from this list, you can either visit the store, or call them.
    Illum knows what has been purchased, so contact them before purchasing from the list. </p>

<p>Web page of Illum: <a href="http://www.houseofoslo.no/butikker/illums_bolighus"> Illums bolighus </a> </p>
<p>Addres: 	Ruseløkkveien 26 Oslo, Telefon: 22 01 55 10 </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Since the wedding takes place in northern Norway, and we live in Oslo, we kindly request that you "leave" the presents
    at Illums (if that is where you purchase them), and we will pick them up when we arrive back in Oslo.
    If you don't use the wedding list, please take into consideration the size of the present too, and possibly
    leave the present in Oslo (if that is possible). </p>
<p>Dersom dere ikke handler på Illums ber vi dere vennligst vurdere om gaven er av et såpass "omfang" at det er enklest å motta den
i Oslo. </p>
